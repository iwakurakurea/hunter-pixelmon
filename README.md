how to install for non computer nerds
--!! be on windows 10 or higher. if you aren't, too bad no mc for you
--!! make sure you have minecraft on your computer already;
--!! ALSO maybe consider doing this through the curseforge
--!! launcher if you'd find that easier

run (double-click) "installgame.bat"
if windows defender pops up telling you it stopped it,
click more info and then click run anyway

a little forge window should open, make sure "Install client" is selected.
leave everything else default and press "OK"

wait for it to install
it might take a while because it has to download the whole
400mb pixelmon mod

a message should appear in the console telling you it's installed
you can double check by seeing if the "shared" and "client" folders are empty
if not contact me

enjoy the game
love, clair <3
