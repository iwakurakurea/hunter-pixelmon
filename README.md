how to install for non computer nerds
--!! be on windows 10 or higher. if you aren't, too bad no mc for you
--!! make sure you have minecraft on your computer already;
--!! ALSO maybe consider doing this through the curseforge
--!! launcher if you'd find that easier

run (double-click) "installgame.bat"

a little forge window should open, make sure "Install client" is selected.
leave everything else default and press "OK"

wait for it to install
it might take a while because it has to download the whole
400mb pixelmon mod

a message should appear in the console telling you it's installed
you can double check by seeing if the "1.16.5" folder is empty
if not contact me

enjoy the game
